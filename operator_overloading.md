# operator_overloading
- it allows to redefine behaviour of operators when working with custom type
- form of [[polymorphism]]
- when overloading an operator, you are difining special function that is called by the compiler when overloaded operator is used
- there is difference between overloading member function and non-member function (member functions take one less argument because there is explicit *this)
