# class
- structs have problems enforcing invariants (somehing condition that has to be true for example denominator cant be 0 - violation can couse undefined behaviour) 
- class is more or less the same as struct technically. The difference is more philosophical meaning that classes indicate practicing [[oop]] 
- the main difference is that members of classes are [private](access_specifiers) by default and members of [[structure]] are [public](access_specifiers)
- classes with private members are not [[aggregate_types]] thus can be initialized with [[aggregate_initialization]]. [[constructor]] is used when initializing class object
