# array
- it is so called **derived data type**
- used to group elements of the same type
- stored in memory countiguously
## [[static_arrays]] 
- fixed size must be known at compile time
## [[dynamic_arrays]]
- they can dynamicly adjust their size at run time
## Why not always use dynamic arrays?
- std::vector is slightly less performant
- THE REAL REASON IS THAT YOU CAN'T USE [[ConstExpr]]
