# downcasting
- proccess of converting pointer of the base [[class]] to the pointer of derived class in [[inheritance]] hierarchy
- in general considered unsafe because base [[pointer]] might not point to the desired derived type (when converting animal object to Dog, animal might actually point to a Cat or plain Animal instead)
- done by [[dynamic_cast]]
