# oop
- counterpart to [[procedural_programing]]
- the focus is to create [[program_defined_types]] with properties and well defined behaviour (functions)
- object in oop is instantiated [[class]]
- because object properties and behaviour are grouped it allows for better modularization and higher degree of reusability
## Properties of OOP
- [[inheritance]]
- [[encapsulation]]
- [[abstraction]]
- [[polymorphism]]
