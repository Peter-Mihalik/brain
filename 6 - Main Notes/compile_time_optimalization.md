# compile_time_optimalization
- some parts of the code can be evaluated at compile time which results in:
	- faster and smaller executables
	- and mostly predictability ([[undefined_behaviour]] is not allowed at compile time)
## Most fundamental techniques
- [[constexpr]] variables
- [[ConstExpr]] functions
- [[functions_templates]]
- [[assert]]
