## Text replacing tool
- i need something to replace my tags with in obsidian files
- idea is to find matching line and then replace matching link with tag but name should be the same for example replace \[\[cpp]]  with \#cpp, \[\[linux]]  with \#linux and so on
- make terminal user interface for replacing any patterns
## Data structure and algorithm visualizer
- start with blank canvas where you can choose what kind of data structure you want to use.
- option to add, delete, modify elements
- more [[data_visualization_program]]
