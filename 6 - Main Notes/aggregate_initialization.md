# aggregate_initialization
- used with [[aggregate_types]]
- allows to directly initiaze members
- it is done by initizer list - {1, 3, 4, 5}
## Initialization
- it can be done by copy-list initialization or list initialization (see [[initialization]]) 
- list initialization is preffered
## Missing memeber initialezers
- when list shorter than theres members
- if member has default value (assigned when defining) it is used otherwise value initialized to 0 (see [[initialization]])
