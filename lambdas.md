# lambdas
- anonymous functions defined close to where they are called (anonymous [[functors]])
- they are used for short inline functions (eliminate the need of creating seperate named functions)
- they improve readeability (they are defined where they are called)
- they can capture variables from their scope
```cpp
[capture list](parameters) -> return_type {
    // function body
}
```
